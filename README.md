Hi! We are a team consisting of two high school sophomore students, **Cindy Huang** and **Jessie Ma**. With scientists in our...
We have decided to create a code to quickly find matches between genes and DNA quickly and efficiently (which takes from 5- 7 hours.)

##About 
[Watch video explaining DNA!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXdzuz5Q-hs)
Many scientists have encountered the problem of taking hours of valuable time to process and find matching gene codes when uploading a file.
##Our goal
As a team, we have decided to make it our task to help scientists save time by making a code to quickly find the matching bar codes.
