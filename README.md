Hi! We are a team consisting of two high school sophomore students, **Cindy Huang** and **Jessie Ma**. Cindy attends Thomas Wootton Hgh School, and Jessie attends Winston Churchill High School. United by their interest in biological scientist, they have decided to collaborate for a summer project to quickly find matches between genes and DNA quickly and efficiently.




##About 
[Watch video explaining DNA!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXdzuz5Q-hs)
As seen from the video, genetic codes have infinte possibilities. Scientists often attempt to find matches between the DNA in which they experimented to find and other genetic codes in a database in order to complete their research.
Many scientists have encountered the problem of taking hours of valuable time to process and find matching gene codes when uploading a file.

**Our goal** 


As a team, we have decided to make it our task to help scientists save time by creating a code to quickly find the matching bar codes.

**How it works**


Users can upload genetics codes into the file, and the code will print out the amout of genetic matches and the frequency. 
Unlike other programs using arrays that would take around 5-7 hours to run, our program utilizes hashmaps to directly find matches in seconds.
