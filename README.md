Hi! We are a team consisting of two high school sophomore students, **Cindy Huang** and **Jessie Ma**. Cindy attends Thomas Wootton High School, and Jessie attends Winston Churchill High School. United by our interest in biological sciences, we have decided to collaborate for a summer project to faciitate scientists jobs that arose. We have decided to create a code that finds matches between barcodes and gene codes quickly and efficiently.





##About 
[Watch video explaining DNA!] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXdzuz5Q-hs)
As seen from the video, genetic codes have infinte possibilities. Scientists often attempt to find matches between the DNA in which they experimented to find and other genetic codes in a database in order to complete their research.


**Why this is important** 
When experimenting with DNA, scientists might discover a mutation. Sometimes, these mutation in DNA  could be a cancer cell.However, because there are so many DNA tested that scientist worked with that it could take hours, and in many cases days, to find what the DNA sequence matches with in the total sequence database. Our program will cut down this time and find matches quickly.
Many scientists have encountered the problem of taking hours of valuable time to process and find matching gene codes when uploading a file.
**How it works**


Users can upload genetics codes into the file, and the code will print out the amout of genetic matches and the frequency. 
Unlike other programs using arrays that would take around 5-7 hours to run, our program utilizes hashmaps to directly find matches in seconds.
